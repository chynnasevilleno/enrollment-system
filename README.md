# enrollment-system
Enrollment system created using C# Winforms.

A project submitted for IT200 under Mr. Patrick Paasa. I was in charge of the overall development of the project with substantial help from my partner who was in charge with functionalities such as searching (implemented using stored procedures), logged on user identification, and adding and editing a subject.

Project Duration: September 23, 2017 - October 5, 2017 (Considering this is our first time coding in C#)


Proponents:

Chynna Sevilleno & Fennald Neffe


Personal notes:

The project could be improved. Form names were confusing for me while development since the names weren't descriptive enough (I felt like changing it would sabotage the whole project. I was in Form 4 then). I found the "edit profile" design too inconsistent with the design scheme I implemented in the whole program as well, and the form layout didn't help much. A user had to input his/her previous username before he/she can change her password or username. I believe the "required" signifier helped a bit, but I felt like I could improve the form's layout more.

I tried to make the project easy to understand by accompanying words with symbols in the home page (functioning like quick links for faster completion of user goals). The "Enrollment Summary" seems to be too vague for a user, I consider it to be a bad microcopy (it could be renamed to "enrollment details" because it's basically showing all enrolled students and clicking on a certain student would display the subjects they are enrolled in).

I'd give this project 8/10 for functionalities, 6/10 for the visual design, 7/10 for UX, 10/10 for effort :D
